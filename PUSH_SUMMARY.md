# Ready to Push - Summary

## Commits Ready
1. **Fix robot ground collision and sinking issues** - Major physics and collision fixes
2. **Update README with ground collision fixes and build clarity** - Documentation updates

## What Was Fixed
- Robot no longer sinks through the ground plane
- Proper minimum body height (0.61m) based on leg geometry  
- Aggressive ground clamping prevents any penetration
- Enhanced physics parameters for stable contacts
- Large foot boxes (8x leg radius) for reliable ground contact

## Clean Repository State
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` file added
- All temporary test files removed
- Build artifacts excluded
- Only essential source files tracked
- No sensitive or unnecessary files

## To Push
```bash
git push origin master
```

## For New Users
After cloning, they need to:
1. Install dependencies (ODE, VSG/OpenGL)
2. `mkdir build && cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make -j8`
5. `./vsg_ode_robot`

The simulation will run with a stable hexapod robot that properly stands on the ground!
