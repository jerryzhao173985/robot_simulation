# Final Summary of Changes

## 1. Keyboard Input - FULLY FUNCTIONAL âœ…
- Implemented comprehensive event debugging system
- Fixed key mappings using correct VSG constants from library headers
- All controls working:
  - **Space**: Toggle manual/autonomous mode
  - **WASD**: Robot movement (forward/back/left/right)
  - **C**: Cycle camera modes
  - **V**: Change debug verbosity
  - **ESC**: Exit simulation

## 2. Performance Optimizations
- Reduced MSAA from 4x to 1x
- Disabled excessive event logging
- Optimized console output (only log changes)
- Removed per-frame debug messages

## 3. Window Size
- Changed from 1920x1080 to 800x600
- Note: macOS retina displays double the resolution (shows as 1600x1200)

## 4. Known Issues
- Frame rate still low (0.43 FPS) - appears to be a Vulkan/macOS issue
- Window generates many resize events on startup

## 5. Testing the Keyboard
Run the simulation and press:
1. **Space** - You'll see "MANUAL CONTROL ACTIVATED" message
2. **W/A/S/D** - You'll see movement vectors in debug output
3. **C** - Camera mode changes (Follow/Free/Orbit/Top/Front/Side)
4. **V** - Debug level changes

The keyboard input system is working correctly. The visual lag is due to the rendering performance issue, not the input system.
