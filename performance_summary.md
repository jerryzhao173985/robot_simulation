# Performance Issues Fixed

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Reduced Event Debugging Overhead**
- Limited ConfigureWindowEvent logging to every 100th event (was logging every single resize)
- Disabled ComprehensiveEventDebugger in main loop
- Disabled TestEventHandler

### 2. **Reduced Console Output in Render Loop**
- Modified InputHandler to only log when movement values change
- Removed per-frame debug output that was flooding console

### 3. **Window Resize Storm**
The massive number of ConfigureWindowEvent messages indicates the window is being resized continuously. This is a critical performance issue.

## Remaining Issues to Investigate:

### 1. **Window Management**
- The window is generating hundreds of resize events per second
- This could be due to macOS window management or VSG configuration
- Need to investigate window creation flags

### 2. **Frame Rate Still Low**
- Current: 0.43 FPS
- Target: 60 FPS
- Something is blocking the render loop

### 3. **Possible Causes**
- Window resize storm consuming GPU/CPU
- VSG present mode settings
- macOS-specific Vulkan performance issues
- High MSAA samples (4x)

## Next Steps:
1. Run the simulation with reduced console output
2. Monitor if frame rate improves without debug logging
3. Consider reducing MSAA samples from 4 to 2
4. Investigate macOS window management issues
